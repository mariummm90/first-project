<h1>WORKING ON GITHUB</h1>
<BR>
<P>Working on GitHub typically involves collaborating on software development projects using Git, a distributed version control system, and GitHub, a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Here's a general outline of how to work on GitHub</P>
<br>
<p>Create a Repository: Once logged in to GitHub, you can create a new repository by clicking on the "+" sign in the top-right corner of the page and selecting "New repository". Give your repository a name, description, and choose whether it should be public or private.

Clone Repository: To work on a project locally, you need to clone the repository to your computer. Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL. This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.</p>
